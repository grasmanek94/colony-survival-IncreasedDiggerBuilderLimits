Mod compatibility:   

- `0.7.1`

Notes:

Don't forget to update the mod `config.json`:

- `Banner.LoadedChunksRadius` to prevent chunk unloading
- `NPCs.BuilderCooldownMultiplierSeconds` to decrease or increase the time it takes to build (lower number = faster)
- `NPCs.DiggerCooldownMultiplierSeconds` to decrease or increase the time it takes to dig (lower number = faster)
- `Colony.ExclusiveRadius` to be able to use the new (bigger) area sizes
